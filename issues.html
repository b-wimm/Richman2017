        <p align="left">
        Ryan recognizes that the key to a thriving city is building community that we can be proud of and feel safe raising our families in.  He is fully dedicated to supporting law enforcement efforts to take drugs off our streets and keep our neighborhoods safe.  He will prioritize public services so Manchester works for all of us.  Fire safety, law enforcement, and quality public education are the cornerstones to a community that attracts and retains young families to build their lives in Manchester, set down roots, buy property, and help spread out the tax burden, allowing the city to reduce taxes without sacrificing vital services. By doing so, we can attract more businesses to Manchester because we will be supplying a steady workforce.</p>
        <h3 align="left">Tackling the Opioid Crisis</h3>
        <p align="left">The opiod crisis is the critical public health crisis of our time.  Ryan will work to ensure the effective care necessary to treat those struggling with addiction.  He will work with community organizations on education and prevention efforts.  Working with these organizations will provide the care and recovery for those suffering from addiction as well as job training and placement so that those recovering from addiction can become contributing members of society again.  He will also work to support our first responders that are on the front lines of the crisis.</p>
        <h3 align="left">Improving Our Public Schools</h3>
        <p align="left">As a veteran public school teacher, Ryan will work to provide our schools the resources necessary for a quality public education for every student.  As the Board of Aldermen works with the Board of School Committee on the district's budget, he will be in a position to make sure that our tax dollars are being spent wisely by prioritizing student success and the quality of education offered in our schools.  Ryan will work tirelessly to ensure that Manchester has quality, competitive schools which are key to attracting and retaining young families to build their lives in Manchester.
