          <h2>About Ryan Richman</h2>
        </div>
        <p align="left">Ryan has worked for 14 years as a public high school social studies teacher in New Hampshire. He moved to New Hampshire at the age of 18 and made the conscious choice to make Manchester his home because of its potential and its sense of community. Inspired by his volunteerism, he will continue to focus on those who do not have the voice to advocate for themselves. He wants to serve as your alderman because he wants to be in a position where he can do the most good to help improve the lives of his neighbors.<br/><br/>
        In addition to his public service, Ryan has performed with the Manchester Choral Society, served as the co-chair of GLSEN NH and is active with several advocacy organizations. He earned his B.A. in History and B.Ed. in Social Studies Education form the University of Lethbridge, his M.A. in U.S. Constitutional History from Salem State University, is a member of the Phi Alpha Theta National History Society, and is a James Madison Fellow for the Study of the Constitution.
